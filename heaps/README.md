## Impressions

+ In general I feel the language is more familiar than TypeScript
    + Much less occurences of "this."
    + No nonsense public/private, interfaces/classes and modules
    + No nonsense getter/setter
    + Porting the code from TS felt like simplifying it
    - No biggie, but arrays miss forEach and find functions
+ The experience in VS Code is actually pretty good, only debug that isn't working for me
- The change-compile-check loop is slower than with Phaser (hot-reload helps)
- The community/ecosystem is still alive, but I perceive its heyday has already passed
    - It's not even close to Godot's size or TypeScript when considering only the language/tooling
- Tricky to make the Tweening library to make smooth animations
